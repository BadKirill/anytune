# anytune

Free tuner for guitar and bass with **fully editable per-string tunings**.

**Live app:** https://badkirill.github.io/anytune/ — open it on your phone and
add it to the home screen to install. Deploys automatically from `master` via
GitHub Actions (see [docs/CI.md](docs/CI.md)).

Pick a preset (Standard, Drop D, Drop C#, Drop C, ...) or tap any string and set it
to any note — for example G#1 D#2 A#2 F1 to play Meshuggah's Demiurge. Then play:
the app listens through the microphone and shows how far each string is from the
target and which way to turn the peg.

One TypeScript codebase for everything: installable Progressive Web App today,
Capacitor-wrapped App Store / Play Store builds later.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server
npm run check      # lint + format + typecheck + unit tests (must pass)
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright end-to-end tests (mic stubbed with an oscillator)
npm run build      # production build (dist/)
```

Requires Node 20+.

## Project structure

- `src/core/` — pure TypeScript domain logic (music math, tunings, analyzer). No React, no browser APIs; fully unit-tested.
- `src/audio/` — microphone capture (AudioWorklet) and pitch detection (pitchy, McLeod method).
- `src/components/` — UI: gauge, string list, note picker, preset picker.
- `src/state/` — tuner screen state.
- `src/storage/` — localStorage persistence of custom tunings.
